      "Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that iteratively steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. \n",
      "\n",
      "Steps for Bubble Sort:\n",
      "1. Compare the first and second elements in the list.\n",
      "2. If the first element is larger than the second, swap them.\n",
      "3. Go to the next pair, compare and swap if necessary.\n",
      "4. Continue this process until you go through the entire list without needing to make any swaps.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main advantage of bubble sort is its simplicity. It is an ideal algorithm for small data sets and for teaching purposes. However, bubble sort is inefficient for larger lists, and seldom used in practice. The time complexity is O(n^2) in the worst and average case.\n",

      "\n",
      "Quick sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm that uses a divide and conquer strategy. \n",
      "\n",
      "Steps for Quick Sort:\n",
      "1. Choose an element from the list as a \"pivot\". (Typically the last element).\n",
      "2. Partitioning: Reorder the array so that all elements with values less than the pivot come before the pivot, while all elements with values greater come after it (equal values can go either way). After this partitioning, the pivot is in its final position.\n",
      "3. Recursively apply these steps to the sub-array of elements with smaller values and the sub-array of elements with greater values.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quick Sort is more efficient than Bubble Sort and it is commonly used in practice. The average and best-case time complexity is O(n log n), with worst-case time complexity of O(n^2). The worst case is not common and can be avoided with certain pivot choosing techniques.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of efficiency:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Quick Sort generally performs better than Bubble Sort as it has an average case time complexity of O(n log n) compared to Bubble Sort’s O(n^2).\n",
      "- Quick Sort also requires less memory than Bubble Sort since it’s an in-place sorting algorithm.\n",
      "\n",
      "When to use each:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Bubble Sort is best used when you're dealing with a small data set or if you know the data is nearly sorted. It's also useful for teaching purposes, as it's easier to understand.\n",
      "- Quick Sort would be the choice for larger data sets and in the vast majority of practical use cases.\n"
