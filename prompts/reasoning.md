# Reasoning Prompting

## Overview
Reasoning prompting is used to enhance logical thinking, decision-making, and problem-solving. It enables language models to break down complex tasks into structured steps, ensuring transparency in the thought process.

## Techniques for Reasoning

### 1️⃣ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting
- Encourages step-by-step reasoning for complex questions.
- Example Prompt:
  ```
  Solve the following problem step by step:
  "A train travels at 80 km/h for 2.5 hours. How far does it travel?"
  ```

### 2️⃣ Self-Consistency Prompting
- Generates multiple independent reasoning paths and selects the most common answer.
- Example Prompt:
  ```
  Answer the following question multiple times and provide the most common answer:
  "If a store sells apples at $3 each and a customer buys 4 apples, how much do they pay?"
  ```

### 3️⃣ Role-Based Reasoning
- Instructs the model to take on a specific role for contextual reasoning.
- Example Prompt:
  ```
  You are a financial analyst. Analyze the following statement and provide a risk assessment:
  "The company’s revenue increased by 20%, but its operational costs rose by 35%."
  ```

### 4️⃣ Counterfactual Reasoning
- Asks the model to consider an alternative scenario to assess outcomes.
- Example Prompt:
  ```
  What would have happened if the internet had never been invented? Provide a logical explanation.
  ```

### 5️⃣ Multi-Step Deductive Reasoning
- Uses a logical progression to reach conclusions based on given facts.
- Example Prompt:
  ```
  Given the following facts:
  1. All mammals are warm-blooded.
  2. Whales are mammals.
  Based on these facts, what can we conclude about whales?
  ```

## Best Practices for Reasoning Prompts
- Use explicit instructions for step-by-step responses.
- Combine multiple reasoning techniques for complex tasks.
- Ask for explanations rather than just answers to validate logic.
- Use few-shot examples for improved response consistency.

## Common Pitfalls
- Over-simplified responses when reasoning steps are not enforced.
- Hallucinated explanations that do not align with the provided facts.
- Misinterpretation when the prompt lacks clear logical constraints.

## Advanced Applications
- Enhancing AI-driven decision support systems.
- Legal and medical reasoning for case assessments.
- Scientific hypothesis generation and validation.
- Strategic business and financial analysis.
