# Summarization Prompting

## Overview
Summarization prompting is used to condense large pieces of text into a concise and meaningful summary. This can be applied in various domains such as news aggregation, research papers, meeting notes, and customer support logs.

## Techniques for Summarization
### 1️⃣ **Zero-Shot Summarization**
- No prior examples are provided; the model must infer the summarization style from the instruction alone.
- **Example Prompt:**
  ```
  Summarize the following text in one sentence:
  "The quarterly financial report indicates a strong increase in revenue due to higher product sales, despite rising operational costs."
  ```

### 2️⃣ **Few-Shot Summarization**
- The model is given examples of summaries to learn from before summarizing the target text.
- **Example Prompt:**
  ```
  Here are examples of summaries:
  - Text: "The company launched a new product, which was well-received by customers."
    Summary: "New product launch successful."
  - Text: "The market has seen a downturn due to economic instability."
    Summary: "Market downturn caused by instability."
  Now summarize: "The recent advancements in AI have led to significant improvements in automation and efficiency."
  ```

### 3️⃣ **Role-Based Summarization**
- The model is assigned a role to adjust the tone and detail level of the summary.
- **Example Prompt:**
  ```
  You are a business analyst. Summarize the following report in a way that highlights key financial takeaways:
  "The company reported a 15% increase in revenue, mainly driven by international expansion. However, operating expenses also increased by 10%, leading to a moderate rise in net profit."
  ```

### 4️⃣ **Bullet Point Summarization**
- The model outputs a structured summary in bullet points for better readability.
- **Example Prompt:**
  ```
  Summarize the following article in bullet points:
  "The new policy changes in the education sector aim to increase funding for public schools, enhance teacher training programs, and introduce digital learning resources. These reforms are expected to improve student outcomes and reduce disparities."
  ```

## Best Practices for Summarization
- Use **clear and direct instructions** (e.g., “Summarize in one sentence” or “Provide a detailed summary”).  
- If needed, specify a **word limit or summary format** (e.g., “Summarize in under 50 words” or “Use bullet points”).  
- **For accuracy**, ensure the model does not omit critical details. Use few-shot examples if necessary.  
- When using **role-based prompting**, choose a role that aligns with the audience (e.g., **journalist, analyst, student**).  

## Common Pitfalls
- **Overly generic summaries** that lose important details.  
- **Hallucinated facts** (Ensure the model does not generate information not present in the text).  
- **Ambiguous instructions** (e.g., “Summarize this” without specifying length or detail level).  

## Advanced Applications
- **Multi-document summarization** (Combine insights from multiple sources).  
- **Context-aware summarization** (Summarize based on a given audience or perspective).  
- **Abstractive vs. Extractive summarization** (Generate a new summary vs. selecting key sentences).
